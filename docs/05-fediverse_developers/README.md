# Fediverse Developers

This page is mainly for outlining the activities and circumstances Mbin sends out activities and 
how activities, objects and actors are represented.
To communicate between instances, Mbin utilizes the ActivityPub protocol 
([ActivityPub standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/), [ActivityPub vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/))
and the [FEP Group federation](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/feps/fep-1b12.md).

## Context

The `@context` property for all Mbin payloads **should** be this:

```json
%@context%
```

The `/contexts` endpoint resolves to this:

```json
%@context_additional%
```

## Actors

The actors Mbin uses are

- the Instance actor (AP `Application`)
- the User actor (AP `Person`)
- the Magazine actor (AP `Group`)

### Instance Actor

Each instance has an instance actor at `https://instance.tld/i/actor` and `https://instance.tld` (they are the same):

```json
%actor_instance%
```

### User actor

Each registered user has an AP actor at `https://instance.tld/u/username`:

```json
%actor_user%
```

### Magazine actor

Each magazine has an AP actor at `https://instance.tld/m/name`:

```json
%actor_magazine%
```

```

## User Activities

### Follow and unfollow

```json

```

Mbin automatically sends an `Accept` activity when a user receives a `Follow` activity.

```json
%activity_user_accept%
```

### Create

```json
%activity_user_create%
```

### Report

```json

### Vote

When a user votes it is translated to a `Like` activity for an up-vote and a `Dislike` activity for a down-vote. 
Down-votes are not federated, yet.

```json

## Magazine Activities

### Announce activities

The magazine is mainly there to announce the activities users do with it as the audience.
The announced type can be `Create`, `Update`, `Add`, `Remove`, `Announce`, `Delete`, `Like`, `Dislike`, `Flag` and `Lock`.
`Announce(Flag)` activities are only sent to instances with moderators of this magazine on them. 

```json
