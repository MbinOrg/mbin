## Reporting Issues

If you observe an error or any other issue, [create an new issue](https://github.com/MbinOrg/mbin/issues) in GitHub. A couple notes about this:

- Please try to verify that your issue is not already present before you create a new issue. You can search on existing open issues.
- We actually prefer you to **not** include `[Feature Request]` or `[Bug Report]` or similar tags in the title. Instead, we'll add the labels for you.
- If you're reporting an issue that happened while you're on a specific instance, please include **the URL**.
- If the issue is related to design/UI, please also **include screenshots**.
- If you're the server admin and have access to logging, please also **include logs** when relevant.
