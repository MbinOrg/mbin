There are several options features in Mbin, which you may want to configure.

- [Single sign-on (SSO)](02-sso.md) - SSO can be configured to allow registrations via other SSO providers.
- [Captcha](03-captcha.md) - Captcha protection against spam and anti-bot.
- [User application approval](04-user_application.md) - Manually approve users before they can log into your server (eg. to avoid spam accounts).
