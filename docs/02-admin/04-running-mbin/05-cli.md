# CLI

When you are the server administrator of the Mbin instance and you have access to the terminal / shell (via SSH for example), Mbin provides you several console commands.

> [!WARNING]
> We assume you are in the root directory of the Mbin instance (eg. `/var/www/mbin`),
> this is the directory location where you want to execute console commands listed below. 

> [!WARNING]
> Run the commands as the correct user. In case you used the `mbin` user during setup,
> switch to the mbin user fist via: `sudo -u mbin bash`
> (or if you used the `www-data` user during setup: `sudo -u www-data bash`).
> This prevent potential unwanted file permission issues.

## Getting started
