# App Developers

If you wish to develop an app that uses the Mbin API end-points, that is possible by using the OAuth2.

## API Endpoints

For all the API endpoints go to the [API documentation page](https://docs.joinmbin.org/api/).

Or use the Swagger documentation on an existing Mbin instance: `https://mbin_site.com/api/docs`. Assuming you setup the server and the API correctly.

## OAuth2 Guide

### Available Grants

1. `client_credentials`
   - [documentation here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/)
   - Best used for bots and clients that only ever need to authenticate as a single user, from a trusted device.
   - Note that bots authenticating with this grant type will be distinguished as bots and will not be allowed to vote on content.
2. `authorization_code`
   - [documentation here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/)
   - public clients must use [PKCE](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/) to authenticate.
   - A public client is any client that will be installed on a device that is not controlled by the client's creator
     - Native apps
     - Single page web apps
     - Or similar
3. `refresh_token`
   - [documentation here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/making-authenticated-requests/refreshing-an-access-token/)
   - Refresh tokens are used with the `authorization_code` grant type to reduce the number of times the user must log in.

### Obtaining OAuth2 credentials from a new server

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these structures contain comments that need to be removed before making the API calls. Copy/paste with care.

1. Create a private OAuth2 client (for use in secure environments that you control)

```
POST /api/client

{
  "name": "My OAuth2 Authorization Code Client",
  "contactEmail": "contact@some.dev",
  "description": "A client that I will be using to authenticate to /mbin's API",
  "public": false,
  "redirectUris": [
    "https://localhost:3000/redirect",
    "myapp://redirect"
  ],
  "grants": [
    "authorization_code",
    "refresh_token"
  ],
  # All the scopes the client will be allowed to request
  # See following section for a list of available fine grained scopes.
  "scopes": [
    "read"
  ]
}
```

2. Save the identifier and secret returned by this API call - this will be the only time you can access the secret for a private client.

```
{
    "identifier": "someRandomString",
    "secret": "anEvenLongerRandomStringThatYouShouldKeepSafe",
    ... # more info about the client that just confirms what you've created
}
```

3. Use the OAuth2 client id and secret you just created to obtain credentials for a user (This is a standard authorization_code OAuth2 flow, which is supported by many libraries for your preferred language)

   1. Begin authorization_code OAuth2 flow

   ```
   GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=(the client id generated at client creation)&redirect_uri=(One of the URIs added during client creation)&scope=(space-delimited list of scopes)&state=(random string for CSRF protection)
   ```

   2. The user will be directed to log in to their account and grant their consent for the scopes you have requested.
   3. When the user grants their consent, their browser will be redirected to the given redirect_uri with a `code` query parameter, as long as it matches one of the URIs provided when the client was created.
   4. After obtaining the code, obtain an authorization token with a multipart/form-data POST request:

   ```
   POST /token

   grant_type=authorization_code
   client_id=(the client id generated at client creation)
   client_secret=(the client secret generated at client creation)
   code=(OAuth2 code received from redirect)
   redirect_uri=(One of the URIs added during client creation)
   ```

   5. The token endpoint will respond with the token and information about it

   ```json
   {
     "token_type": "Bearer",
     "expires_in": 3600, // seconds
     "access_token": "aLargeEncodedTokenToBeUsedInTheAuthorizationHeader",
     "refresh_token": "aLargeEncodedTokenToBeUsedInTheRefreshTokenFlow"
   }
   ```
